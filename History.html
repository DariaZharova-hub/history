<blockquote> History (<ins>derived from Ancient Greek ἱστορία (historía) 'inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation'</ins>) is the systematic study and documentation of human past. History is an academic discipline which uses a narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze past events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect. Historians debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects. Historians debate the nature of history as an end in itself, and its usefulness in giving perspective on the problems of the present. </blockquote>

<blockquote> The period of events before the invention of writing systems is considered prehistory.<mark> "History" </mark> is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events. Historians seek knowledge of the past using historical sources such as: <br> written documents <br> oral accounts  <br> traditional oral histories, art and material artifacts, and ecological markers.

<h2 > <font color="0a5845" > Etymology </font></h2>
<hr>
<blockquote> The word <sub>history</sub> comes from <sup>historía</sup> (Ancient Greek: ἱστορία, romanized: historíā, lit. 'inquiry, knowledge from inquiry, or judge'). It was in that sense that Aristotle used the word in his History of Animals.The ancestor word ἵστωρ is attested early on in <font color="white">Homeric Hymns, Heraclitus, the Athenian ephebes </font> oath, and in Boeotic inscriptions <pre>(in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness", or similar).</pre>
The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as historia, meaning "investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative". History was borrowed from Latin (possibly via Old Irish or Old Welsh) into Old English as stær ("history, narrative, story"), <strong> but </strong> this word fell out of use in the late Old English period. Meanwhile, as Latin became Old French (and Anglo-Norman), historia developed into forms such as istorie, estoire, and historie, with new developments in the meaning: "account of the events of a person's life (beginning of the 12th century), chronicle, account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events (c. 1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (c. 1265), narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c. 1462)".</blockquote>
